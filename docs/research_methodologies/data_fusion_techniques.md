# Data Fusion & Hybrid Modeling

## Data Fusion Techniques

1.  **Sensor Data Fusion:**
    *   Multi-sensor data integration
    *   Time series alignment
    *   Quality assessment and validation
    *   Calibration and normalization

2.  **Semantic Data Integration:**
    *   Ontology-based data integration
    *   Entity resolution and linking
    *   Schema mapping and alignment
    *   Knowledge graph construction

3.  **Spatiotemporal Data Fusion:**
    *   Geospatial data integration
    *   Temporal alignment
    *   Resolution harmonization
    *   Missing data imputation

## Hybrid Modeling Approaches

1.  **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs):**
    *   Integration of physical laws into neural networks
    *   Conservation laws as soft constraints
    *   Physical parameter estimation
    *   Model regularization through physics

2.  **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**
    *   Spatial relationship modeling
    *   Field-level interactions
    *   Environmental factor integration
    *   Network-based predictions

3.  **Federated Learning:**
    *   Decentralized model training
    *   Privacy-preserving data sharing
    *   Model aggregation strategies
    *   Local model optimization

## Data Quality Assurance

1.  **Data Validation:**
    *   Automated quality checks
    *   Anomaly detection
    *   Cross-validation
    *   Consistency checks

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Feature engineering
    *   Data cleaning
    *   Normalization
    *   Missing value handling

3.  **Data Versioning:**
    *   Version control for datasets
    *   Data lineage tracking
    *   Change management
    *   Reproducibility assurance
