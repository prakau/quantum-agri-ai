# Causal Inference & Explainability (XAI)

## Causal Inference Techniques

1.  **Bayesian Networks:**
    *   Graphical models that represent probabilistic relationships among variables.
    *   Used to infer causal relationships from observational data.
2.  **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM):**
    *   Statistical technique used to test and estimate causal relationships among variables.
    *   Combines statistical data with qualitative causal assumptions.
3.  **Counterfactual Reasoning:**
    *   Involves reasoning about what would have happened if a different action had been taken.
    *   Used to evaluate the causal effect of interventions.
4.  **Do-Calculus:**
    *   Mathematical framework for reasoning about causal effects in the presence of interventions.
    *   Provides rules for manipulating causal expressions.

## Explainability Methods

1.  **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):**
    *   Game-theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model.
    *   Assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction.
2.  **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):**
    *   Explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and local way.
    *   Perturbs the input data and learns a local linear model to explain the prediction.
3.  **GAMs (Generalized Additive Models):**
    *   Flexible regression technique that allows for non-linear relationships between predictors and response.
    *   Inherently interpretable due to the additive nature of the model.
4.  **Rule-based Systems:**
    *   Use a set of rules to make predictions.
    *   Easy to understand and interpret.
