3.  **Accountability:**
    *   Clear responsibility assignment
    *   Regular model audits
    *   Documentation of decision-making processes
    *   Incident response procedures

4.  **Privacy:**
    *   Data minimization
    *   Secure data handling
    *   User consent management
    *   Privacy-preserving techniques

5.  **Security:**
    *   Model robustness testing
