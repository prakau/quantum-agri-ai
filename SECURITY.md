# Security Policy

## Quantum Security Architecture

The Messium Agri-AI platform implements state-of-the-art quantum security measures:

1. **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**
   - Secure key exchange using quantum mechanics principles
   - Detection of eavesdropping attempts
   - Automatic key regeneration on detection of tampering
   - Error rate monitoring and thresholds

2. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**
   - Post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
   - Elliptic curve cryptography with enhanced security parameters
   - Regular key rotation policies
   - Hybrid classical-quantum encryption schemes

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** disclose the vulnerability publicly
2. Email the security team at security@messium-agri-ai.com
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Wait for acknowledgment (within 24 hours)
