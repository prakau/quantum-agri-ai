# Quantum Security

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of quantum security measures for the Messium Agri-AI platform.

## Security Measures

1.  **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):**
    *   Secure key exchange using quantum mechanics.
    *   Provides unconditional security.

2.  **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography:**
    *   Classical cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers.
    *   Post-quantum cryptography.

## Implementation Steps

1.  Choose quantum security technologies.
2.  Implement quantum key distribution.
3.  Implement quantum-resistant cryptography.
4.  Evaluate performance.
