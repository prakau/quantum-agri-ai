    *   Features:
        - Immutable storage
        - Original format preservation
        - Full history retention
        - Source system metadata
    *   Data Types:
        - Sensor data
        - Weather data
        - Satellite imagery
        - Farm management data

2.  **Processing Zone (Silver):**
    *   Purpose: Store cleaned and standardized data
    *   Features:
        - Data validation
        - Schema enforcement
        - Data quality checks
        - Versioning
    *   Transformations:
        - Data cleansing
        - Format standardization
        - Schema alignment
        - Quality improvements

3.  **Curated Zone (Gold):**
    *   Purpose: Store business-ready data
    *   Features:
        - Optimized formats
        - Aggregated views
        - Business metrics
        - Analysis-ready datasets
    *   Use Cases:
        - Machine learning
